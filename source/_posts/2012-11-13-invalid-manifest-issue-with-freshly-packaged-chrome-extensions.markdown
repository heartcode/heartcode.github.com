Today I had some spare time and I thought it was a great opportunity to do some JavaScript code refactoring on my Fontier Chrome extension. The refactoring process didnâ€™t take long, as the application itself is very simple, but when I was ready and tried to update the add-on on the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard I found myself staring at some very strange error message popping up above the address bar. 

Chrome Version 23.0.1271.64
