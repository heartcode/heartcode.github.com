Hi, I am Robert Pataki, and that is Totoro. I know that some people have imaginary friends and others think that is insane, but I know that Totoro is for real :)

I have been a Flash Designer and Developer for almost 10 years now, and most recently I started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which I am really enjoying.

I am using my Flash coding experience and everything I've seen and learned from other great developers to do my own experiments and to learn everything that makes someone a good developer. I think that technology is very exciting, and that the learning curve never ends.

The Heartcode blog is about my personal experiences and experiments, which I am planning to share as reguralry as possible. I am always thinking about new stuff, and I am always working on something exciting, so stay tuned :)
